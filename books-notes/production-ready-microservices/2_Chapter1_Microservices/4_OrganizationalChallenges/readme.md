# Organizational Challenges

When we find ourselves presented with technology that promises to offer us drastic improvements, we need to look for the trade-offs. Microservices promise greater scalability and greater efficiency, but we know that those will come at a cost to some part of the overall system.

There are four especially significant trade-offs that come with microservice architecture.

The first is the change in organizational structure that tends toward isolation and poor cross-team communication — a consequence of the inverse of Conway’s Law.

The second is the dramatic increase in technical sprawl, sprawl that is extraordinarily costly not only to the entire organization but which also presents significant costs to each engineer.

The third trade-off is the increased ability of the system to fail.

The fourth is the competition for engineering and infrastructure resources.

## The Inverse Conway’s Law

the organizational structure of a company is determined by the architecture of its product.

Microservice architecture is comprised of a large number of small, isolated, independent microservices. The Inverse Conway’s Law demands that the organizational structure of any company using microservice architecture will be made up of a large number of very small, isolated, and independent teams.

There is also a large communication gap between microservice teams and infrastructure teams that needs to be closed.
