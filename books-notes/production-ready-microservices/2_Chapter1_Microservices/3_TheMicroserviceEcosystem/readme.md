# The Microservice Ecosystem

In well-designed, sustainable microservice ecosystems, the microservices are abstracted away from all infrastructure. They are abstracted away from the hardware, abstracted away from
the networks, abstracted away from the build and deployment pipeline, abstracted away from service discovery and load balancing. This is all part of the infrastructure of the microservice ecosystem, and building, standardizing, and maintaining this infrastructure in a stable, scalable, fault-tolerant, and reliable way is essential for successful microservice operation.

In well-designed, sustainable microservice ecosystems, the microservices are abstracted away from all infrastructure -  hardware, networks, build and deployment pipeline, service discovery and load balancing.

Developing a microservice within a stable microservice ecosystem should be just like developing a small standalone application. This requires very sophisticated, top-notch infrastructure.

The microservice ecosystem can be split into four layers - Hardware, Communication, Application platform, Microservices. The first three layers are the infrastructure layers, the fourth (top) layer is where all individual microservices live.
