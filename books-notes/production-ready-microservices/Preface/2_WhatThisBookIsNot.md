# What This Book Is Not

This book is not a step-by-step how-to guide. It is a highly abstract book.

...introduce concepts, explain their importance to building production-ready microservices, offer examples of each concept, and share strategies for their implementation.

...not a description of the Uber engineering organization.

...not a descriptive or historical account,
but a prescriptive guide to building production-ready microservices.
