# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a `2 * N` Grid of numbers, choose numbers such that the sum of the numbers is maximum, and, no two chosen numbers are adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and return it.

**Example:**

```text
Grid:
    1 2 3 4
    2 3 4 5
so we will choose
3 and 5 so sum will be 3 + 5 = 8
```

**Note:** You can choose more than 2 numbers
