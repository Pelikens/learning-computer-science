# Problem Definition

## Description

Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Note:**

1. You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.
