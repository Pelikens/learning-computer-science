# Problem Definition

## Description

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Example 1:**

Input: 123
Output: 321

**Example 2:**

Input: -123
Output: -321

**Example 3:**

Input: 120
Output: 21

**Note:**

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2<sup>31</sup>,  2<sup>31</sup> − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
